GEMS System Schematic

This schematic illustrates the major subsystems of the Gas Emergency Management System (GEMS) and the flow of materials through the device.
It provides a high-level structural reference for orientation only; detailed behavior, thermal logic, and failure modes are documented in the corresponding sections of the repository.

Subsystems Depicted
1. Passive Regolith Intake Unit

Captures local fines over long durations.

No continuous power or mechanical operation required.

Funnels accumulated material toward the transfer gateway.

2. Hybrid Nudge Transfer Mechanism

Low-power actuators periodically move regolith into the processing chamber.

Designed for long idle periods with minimal wear.

3. Oxygen Processing Core

Contains the oxygen-separation method (thermal cracking, chemical reduction, or membrane configuration).

Fully isolated from the lunar environment and shielded for thermal stability.

4. Buffer and Storage Manifold

Regulates oxygen delivery during emergencies.

Smooths output spikes and stabilizes flow toward the habitat interface.

5. Emergency Control Logic

Minimal-complexity decision pathway.

Activated only during critical oxygen or power failures.

Can operate from backup battery or isolated power trickle.

Intended Use of This Schematic

Reference for engineers reviewing system architecture.

Orientation map for deployment planning and external housing layout.

Visual grounding for other documentation (flowcharts, thermal notes, etc.).

Helps clarify how each subsystem interlocks and why GEMS remains reliable after long dormancy.

The schematic is not meant to show fine detail such as materials, tolerances, or thermal shielding — those are documented separately.
