Phase 2 — Planning-Grade Cost, Mass & Complexity Model

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document provides planning-grade estimates for cost, mass, and system complexity to support Phase 2 reasoning.

All values and relationships are directional, not predictive.
They exist to surface drivers, sensitivities, and tradeoffs, not to set budgets, quotes, or schedules.

Modeling Philosophy

Order-of-magnitude thinking only

Drivers matter more than numbers

Ranges are preferred over point values

Assumptions are explicit

No estimate implies commitment or readiness

Phase 2 answers “What dominates cost, mass, and complexity if someone chose to execute?”

Cost Model (Directional)
Primary Cost Drivers

Structural materials and fabrication approach

Internal geometry complexity

Dust-tolerant design features

Environmental survivability assumptions

Documentation and qualification burden (non-hardware)

Cost Categories (Relative)
Category	Relative Contribution
Structure & housing	Medium
Internal geometry & routing	Medium
Environmental survivability	High
Electronics (if any)	Low
Integration overhead	High
Cost Sensitivities

Costs increase rapidly with:

Pressure containment assumptions

Active components

Tight tolerances

Environmental qualification requirements

Costs decrease with:

Fully passive architectures

Loose tolerances

Non-reusable designs

Emergency-only duty cycles

No dollar values are asserted in Phase 2.

Mass Model (Directional)
Primary Mass Contributors

Structural housing thickness

Internal volume requirements

Dust-tolerant geometry

Mounting or shielding assumptions

Mass Characteristics

Mass is driven more by robustness than performance

Lightweight optimization is not assumed

Mass reduction trades directly against survivability and tolerance

Mass Sensitivities

Mass increases with:

Structural overbuild

Environmental margins

Internal buffering volume

Mass decreases with:

Minimal containment

Reduced internal volume

Acceptance of single-use or degradable behavior

No mass targets are selected.

Complexity Model
Complexity Definition (Phase 2)

Complexity is defined as:

Number of distinct subsystems

Degree of coupling between subsystems

Requirement for active control or coordination

Sensitivity to environmental variability

Complexity Drivers

Complexity increases with:

Active control logic

Tight integration with external systems

Redundancy strategies

Recovery or self-healing behavior

Complexity decreases with:

Passive operation

Loose coupling

Deterministic behavior

Accepting degradation and failure

Cost–Mass–Complexity Trade Relationships
Design Choice	Cost	Mass	Complexity
Passive geometry	↓	↑	↓
Active control	↑	↓	↑
High survivability	↑	↑	↑
Single-use design	↓	↓	↓
Tight integration	↑	↓	↑

These relationships are directional, not quantified.

Planning Use Only

This model may be used to:

Compare architectures

Identify dominant drivers

Eliminate implausible options

Inform Phase 3 scoping discussions

This model may not be used to:

Justify funding requests

Set budgets

Price hardware

Commit schedules

Relationship to Other Phase 2 Artifacts

References System Decomposition for subsystem count

Respects Performance Bounds (no optimization)

Uses Operating Envelope assumptions

Aligns with Failure Philosophy (degradation accepted)

Conflicts must be resolved by revisiting assumptions, not by tightening estimates.

Phase 2 Completion Condition (for This Step)

This step is complete when:

Dominant cost, mass, and complexity drivers are identified

No numeric commitments are implied

Tradeoffs are explicit and directional

Plain-English Summary

This document explains what would drive cost, weight, and complexity for GEMS without assigning budgets or targets. It highlights what makes the system expensive or simple so later phases can make informed choices.
