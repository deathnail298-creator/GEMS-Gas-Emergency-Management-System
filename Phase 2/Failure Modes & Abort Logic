Phase 2 — Failure Modes & Abort Logic

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document defines the anticipated failure modes, degradation behavior, and abort logic for GEMS during Phase 2 analysis.

The goal is not to eliminate failure, but to understand it, bound it, and prevent unsafe interpretation.
All behavior described here is analytical and non-executing.

Failure Philosophy

Failure is expected

Degradation is preferable to abrupt loss

Passive failure is preferable to active recovery

Abort logic is conceptual, not implemented

Phase 2 answers “What happens when things go wrong?” — not “How do we guarantee success?”

Failure Mode Categories
1. Intake Failure

Description:

Partial or complete blockage of intake geometry

Obstruction by dust, debris, or environmental accumulation

Expected Behavior:

Reduced or zero intake

No self-clearing requirement

No active mitigation

Failure Classification:

Tolerable

Non-catastrophic

2. Internal Routing Failure

Description:

Bridging or clogging within internal routing paths

Settling-induced stagnation

Expected Behavior:

Flow reduction or stoppage

Gas retained internally or vented passively

Failure Classification:

Tolerable

Predictable degradation

3. Storage / Buffer Saturation

Description:

Internal volumes reach capacity

Temporary containment no longer available

Expected Behavior:

Flow stalls

Passive venting or back-pressure relief by geometry

Failure Classification:

Tolerable

Non-hazardous by design assumption

4. Activation Failure

Description:

Failure to transition from dormant to active behavior

Partial activation only

Expected Behavior:

System remains inert or partially functional

No unintended activation

Failure Classification:

Tolerable

Loss of function, not hazard creation

5. Structural Degradation

Description:

Material wear

Cracking

Loss of integrity due to environment or age

Expected Behavior:

Gradual performance loss

No sudden energetic failure assumed

Failure Classification:

Tolerable

End-of-life condition

6. Environmental Overstress

Description:

Thermal extremes beyond assumed envelope

Dust exposure beyond assumed bounds

Expected Behavior:

Accelerated degradation

Reduced operational effectiveness

Failure Classification:

Conditionally tolerable

Severity depends on extent of overstress

Catastrophic Failure Definition (Phase 2)

A catastrophic failure is defined as:

Creation of a new hazard

Uncontrolled release of energy

Damage propagation beyond GEMS boundary

Phase 2 assumes catastrophic failure is not the nominal mode, but does not claim it is impossible.

Abort Logic (Conceptual Only)
Abort Definition

An abort is a passive cessation of function intended to prevent escalation.

Abort does not imply:

Active control

Autonomous decision-making

Operator intervention

Abort Triggers (Analytical)

Persistent blockage

Internal saturation

Structural compromise

Environmental overstress

Abort Behavior

Transition to inert state

Passive venting or isolation

No re-attempt logic assumed

Abort is considered successful if:

No new hazard is created

System does not escalate failure

Degradation vs Abort Distinction
Condition	Outcome
Reduced performance	Degradation
Loss of function	Degradation
Risk of escalation	Abort
Creation of hazard	Catastrophic (out of scope)
Relationship to Other Phase 2 Artifacts

Failure modes reference System Decomposition

Abort logic respects Performance Bounds

Environmental triggers reference Operating Envelope

No Phase 2 document overrides another; conflicts must be resolved explicitly.

Phase 2 Completion Condition (for This Step)

This step is complete when:

Major failure modes are enumerated

Failure outcomes are classified

Abort behavior is passive and bounded

No execution or recovery mechanisms are implied

Plain-English Summary

This document explains how GEMS is expected to fail, degrade, or shut itself down without creating new hazards. It treats failure as normal and focuses on preventing escalation rather than guaranteeing success.
