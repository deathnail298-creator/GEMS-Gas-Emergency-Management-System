Phase 2 — Scope & Exclusions

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document defines the allowed scope and hard exclusions for Phase 2 work on GEMS.

Phase 2 exists to convert a feasible concept (Phase 1) into a fully reasoned, engineerable system description without authorizing execution, testing, fabrication, or deployment.

This document is the guardrail for all Phase 2 content.

Phase 2 Scope (Allowed Work)

Phase 2 may include the following activities and outputs.

1. System-Level Reasoning

Full system decomposition into subsystems

Definition of system boundaries and interfaces

Identification of inputs, outputs, and dependencies

Clear separation between GEMS and external systems

2. Environmental Reasoning

Vacuum assumptions

Thermal environment assumptions

Dust exposure assumptions

Mission-context reasoning (e.g., surface, subsurface, emergency-only operation)

All environmental content is analytical, not validated.

3. Performance Bounding (Non-Optimized)

Upper and lower performance bounds

“Cannot exceed” and “must at least tolerate” style reasoning

Constraint-driven estimates

Phase 2 does not select targets or optimize performance.

4. Subsystem Trade Studies

Passive vs active approaches

Complexity vs robustness tradeoffs

Failure tolerance vs efficiency tradeoffs

Architecture comparisons

Trade studies may eliminate options but do not commit to builds.

5. Failure & Degradation Reasoning

Failure modes and effects

Graceful degradation paths

Catastrophic vs tolerable failures

Abort or isolation logic (conceptual)

No reliability claims are made.

6. Planning-Grade Modeling

Cost drivers (directional)

Mass drivers (directional)

Power and thermal drivers (directional)

Schedule drivers (conceptual)

All numbers are planning estimates, not commitments.

Explicit Phase 2 Exclusions (Non-Negotiable)

The following are not allowed in Phase 2 content.

1. Execution Activities

Hardware fabrication

Prototype construction

Testing or experimentation

Environmental validation

Field trials

Phase 2 authorizes zero execution.

2. Readiness or Qualification Claims

No TRL advancement claims

No flight readiness claims

No operational readiness claims

No certification language

3. Manufacturing & Production

No manufacturing plans

No tooling design

No supply-chain commitments

No production schedules

4. Commercial or Contractual Actions

No proposals

No bids

No commercialization plans

No pricing commitments

No customer-specific tailoring

5. Optimization or Final Design Lock

No finalized geometries

No tolerance stackups

No materials selection freeze

No optimization language (“best”, “ideal”, “maximized”)

Phase 2 explores — it does not lock.

Relationship to Other Phases
Phase 1

Phase 1 is frozen and authoritative for feasibility

Phase 2 may refine or contradict Phase 1 conclusions

Phase 1 meaning is not retroactively altered

Phase 3

Phase 3 authorizes execution

Phase 2 content may inform Phase 3

Phase 2 alone grants no execution rights

Phase 2 Completion Condition (for This Step)

This step is complete when:

Scope boundaries are unambiguous

Exclusions clearly block execution and overreach

Later Phase 2 documents can be rejected if they violate this scope

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is limited to analysis, reasoning, and planning-level modeling. It explicitly forbids building, testing, manufacturing, optimization, or commercialization, ensuring that all Phase 2 work remains non-executing and review-safe.
