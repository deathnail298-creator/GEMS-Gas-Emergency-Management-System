Phase 2 — Performance Bounds (Non-Optimized)

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document establishes upper and lower performance bounds for GEMS to support Phase 2 reasoning.

These bounds are constraints, not targets.
They define what GEMS cannot exceed, must at least tolerate, or may reasonably achieve without implying optimization, validation, or readiness.

Bounding Philosophy

Bounds replace goals

Ranges replace point estimates

“Not to exceed” and “not required to exceed” language is used deliberately

No bound implies demonstrated capability

Phase 2 answers “What is plausible within constraints?” — not “What should we build?”

Bounded Performance Domains
1. Throughput (Gas Handling)

Lower Bound (Analytical):

GEMS may process non-continuous, intermittent gas volumes

Zero throughput during dormancy is acceptable

Upper Bound (Analytical):

GEMS is not expected to support sustained, high-flow operation

Any architecture requiring continuous flow is out of scope

Interpretation:

Intermittent handling is acceptable

Continuous processing is neither required nor claimed

2. Activation Latency

Lower Bound (Analytical):

Immediate activation is not required

Upper Bound (Analytical):

Activation delays must not be so long as to negate emergency usefulness

Interpretation:

Latency is bounded by practicality, not precision

No real-time or instantaneous response claims are made

3. Operational Duration

Lower Bound (Analytical):

Single-event operation is acceptable

Upper Bound (Analytical):

Long-duration or continuous operation is not required

Interpretation:

GEMS may be consumed, exhausted, or degraded by use

Reusability is not assumed

4. Efficiency

Lower Bound (Analytical):

Inefficient operation is acceptable if behavior is predictable

Upper Bound (Analytical):

No efficiency maximization is assumed

No yield or purity guarantees are made

Interpretation:

Reliability of behavior is valued over efficiency

5. Storage / Containment

Lower Bound (Analytical):

Temporary buffering only

Upper Bound (Analytical):

No long-term or high-pressure storage claims

No containment certification implied

Interpretation:

Storage is incidental, not primary

6. Dust Tolerance

Lower Bound (Analytical):

Partial blockage and performance degradation are acceptable

Upper Bound (Analytical):

Dust tolerance is not required to be perfect or self-clearing

Interpretation:

Degradation is expected

Catastrophic failure is not assumed by default

Performance Bound Violations (Disallowed Interpretations)

Phase 2 explicitly does not allow:

“Designed for maximum throughput”

“Optimized efficiency”

“Guaranteed response time”

“Rated capacity”

“Certified operating envelope”

Any language implying optimization violates Phase 2 scope.

Relationship to Phase 1 & Phase 3
Phase 1

Phase 1 validates behavioral plausibility

Phase 2 bounds what that behavior could reasonably look like

Phase 3

Phase 3 may convert bounds into targets

Phase 3 may select operating points

Phase 3 may authorize execution

Phase 2 alone does none of these.

Phase 2 Completion Condition (for This Step)

This step is complete when:

All major performance domains have explicit bounds

No bound implies optimization or validation

Later Phase 2 documents reference these bounds consistently

Plain-English Summary

This document sets non-optimized performance limits for GEMS so Phase 2 analysis stays realistic without promising efficiency, capacity, or readiness. It defines what GEMS might reasonably handle — and just as importantly, what it is not expected to do.
