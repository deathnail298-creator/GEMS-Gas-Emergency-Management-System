Phase 2 — System Boundary & Decomposition

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document defines the system boundary for GEMS and decomposes the system into conceptual subsystems for Phase 2 analysis.

The intent is to make clear:

What GEMS is

What GEMS is not

Where responsibility begins and ends

How later analysis will be structured

This document introduces structure only.
It does not imply execution, validation, or final design.

System Boundary Definition
GEMS System Boundary

GEMS is defined as a standalone emergency gas-management subsystem intended to operate as a passive or low-complexity safety component within a larger mission architecture.

GEMS responsibility begins at:

Gas/dust intake interface

GEMS responsibility ends at:

Defined gas output or containment interface

Everything outside those interfaces is external to GEMS.

External Systems (Explicitly Out of Scope)

The following systems are not part of GEMS, even if they interact with it:

Habitats or pressurized volumes

Vehicles or surface infrastructure

Power generation systems

Life support systems

Crew interfaces

Control software or autonomy frameworks

Communications systems

GEMS does not control, command, or depend on these systems.

Top-Level Functional Decomposition

GEMS is decomposed into the following conceptual subsystems for Phase 2 reasoning.

1. Intake Subsystem

Function:
Accept gas and entrained particulates into GEMS.

Scope Includes:

Intake geometry

Passive acceptance behavior

Dust-tolerant design assumptions

Scope Excludes:

Active valves

Powered suction

Flow regulation

2. Capture & Conditioning Subsystem

Function:
Separate, settle, or condition incoming gas and particulates.

Scope Includes:

Expansion volumes

Settling regions

Geometry-driven separation

Scope Excludes:

Active filtration

Electrostatic or magnetic separation

Precision conditioning

3. Routing & Storage Subsystem

Function:
Direct gas internally and optionally store or buffer it.

Scope Includes:

Passive routing paths

Internal volumes

Temporary containment assumptions

Scope Excludes:

Pressure vessels

High-pressure storage

Long-term containment guarantees

4. Activation & State Logic (Conceptual)

Function:
Define how GEMS transitions from dormant to active behavior.

Scope Includes:

Conceptual activation triggers

Deterministic state descriptions

Scope Excludes:

Software control

Autonomous decision-making

Feedback-driven behavior

5. Structural & Environmental Interface

Function:
Define how GEMS exists physically within an environment.

Scope Includes:

Structural housing concepts

Environmental exposure assumptions

Mounting or placement reasoning

Scope Excludes:

Structural certification

Load-bearing integration

Deployment mechanisms

6. Failure & Degradation Domain

Function:
Define how GEMS behaves when things go wrong.

Scope Includes:

Blockage

Partial failure

Reduced effectiveness

Passive failure states

Scope Excludes:

Redundancy strategies

Fault-tolerant electronics

Recovery automation

Inter-Subsystem Relationships

All subsystems are loosely coupled

No subsystem requires real-time coordination

No subsystem assumes powered control

Failure of one subsystem does not induce catastrophic behavior in others by design

Subsystem relationships are conceptual, not implemented.

Phase 2 Boundary Enforcement Rules

During Phase 2:

Subsystems may be refined or subdivided

Subsystems may be removed or merged

New subsystems may be proposed only if they remain passive and non-executing

Any subsystem that implies:

Testing

Fabrication

Control software

Operational dependency

…is out of Phase 2 scope.

Phase 2 Completion Condition (for This Step)

This step is complete when:

All GEMS responsibilities are bounded

External systems are clearly excluded

Later Phase 2 analysis can reference subsystems without redefining scope

Plain-English Summary

This document defines what GEMS includes, what it explicitly excludes, and breaks the system into simple conceptual subsystems so Phase 2 analysis stays organized and non-executing.
