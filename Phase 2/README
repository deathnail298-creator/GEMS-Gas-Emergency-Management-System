# GEMS — Phase 2 (Engineering & Planning Package)

This repository contains **Phase 2 engineering and planning work** for the Gas Emergency Management System (GEMS).

Phase 2 builds on the frozen Phase 1 feasibility package and transitions the system from “physically plausible” to **engineerable, analyzable, and scorable**.

Phase 2 is where assumptions are tightened, trade spaces are explored, and constraints are made explicit.

## What Phase 2 IS

Phase 2 **is**:
- Engineering analysis and refinement
- Trade-space exploration
- Environmental reasoning (vacuum, thermal, mission context)
- Performance modeling and bounding
- Interface and integration reasoning
- Failure-tree expansion
- Cost, mass, and complexity drivers made explicit

Phase 2 exists to answer:

> “If someone chose to build this, what would they actually be committing to?”

---

## What Phase 2 IS NOT

Phase 2 is **not**:
- A prototype build
- A test campaign
- A qualification effort
- A manufacturing plan
- A deployment commitment
- A certification claim

Phase 2 does not produce hardware.
Phase 2 does not advance TRL by itself.

---

## Relationship to Phase 1

- Phase 1 is **frozen** and stands on its own.
- Phase 2 may refine, contradict, or discard Phase 1 conclusions.
- Nothing in Phase 2 retroactively changes what Phase 1 meant.

Phase 1 answers *“Is this plausible?”*  
Phase 2 answers *“What does it really take?”*

## Phase 2 Outputs (Representative)

Phase 2 work may include:
- Environmental operating envelopes
- Thermal and power reasoning
- Performance bounds (not guarantees)
- Subsystem trade studies
- Interface definitions
- Failure trees and abort logic
- Planning-grade cost and schedule models

These outputs are analytical and preparatory in nature.

## Execution Boundary

Phase 2 content **authorizes no execution** by itself.

Any physical build, testing, fabrication, proposal use, or commercialization requires a **separate execution license**.

---

## License

Phase 2 content is governed by the license in `LICENSE`.  
Reading is permitted. Execution is restricted.

## Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 explains what it would actually take to engineer GEMS without claiming that it has been built, tested, or proven. It turns the idea into a serious, analyzable system while stopping short of execution.
