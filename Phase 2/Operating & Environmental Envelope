Phase 2 — Operating & Environmental Envelope

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document defines the assumed operating and environmental envelope for GEMS during Phase 2 analysis.

These conditions are analytical assumptions, not validated limits.
They exist to bound reasoning, modeling, and trade studies without authorizing testing or execution.

Envelope Philosophy

All values are assumed, not proven

Assumptions are intentionally conservative

Where uncertainty exists, bounds are used instead of point values

No assumption implies survivability, qualification, or readiness

Phase 2 answers “what must be reasoned about,” not “what has been demonstrated.”

Operating Mode Assumptions
Operational Role

Emergency or contingency operation

Intermittent use

Long dormant periods punctuated by short active intervals

Duty Cycle (Assumed)

Predominantly dormant

Short-duration activation

No requirement for continuous operation

No assumptions are made about:

Frequency of activation

Total lifetime cycles

Operational availability

Environmental Domains Considered
1. Pressure Environment (Analytical)

Near-vacuum external environment assumed

Internal pressures assumed to be low and transient

No sustained pressure differentials assumed

Phase 2 does not assume pressure containment or pressure-rated components.

2. Thermal Environment (Analytical)

Wide external temperature swings assumed

Passive thermal behavior only

No active heating or cooling assumed

Thermal reasoning is limited to:

Survivability logic

Material compatibility considerations

Gross thermal gradients

No thermal qualification claims are made.

3. Dust & Particulate Environment

High dust exposure assumed

Fine and abrasive particulates considered

Dust intrusion treated as normal, not anomalous

Phase 2 assumes:

Dust tolerance is required

Dust mitigation is passive

Dust accumulation is not catastrophic by default

4. Mechanical & Structural Environment

Static or quasi-static placement assumed

No dynamic loads assumed beyond incidental contact

No shock, vibration, or launch loads considered

Structural reasoning is conceptual only.

5. Radiation Environment

Radiation exposure acknowledged

No radiation-hardening assumptions

No electronics survivability claims

Radiation is treated as a background constraint, not a design driver in Phase 2.

Interfaces to Environment
Environmental Interfaces Include:

Gas intake exposure

Dust exposure

Thermal exposure

Mechanical contact with surrounding structures or terrain

Environmental Interfaces Exclude:

Active sealing

Controlled atmospheres

Human interaction requirements

Envelope Boundaries (Explicit Non-Assumptions)

Phase 2 does not assume:

Certified operating temperature limits

Guaranteed minimum or maximum pressures

Verified material performance

Long-term durability

Any such claims belong to Phase 3 or later.

Use of Envelope in Phase 2

This envelope is used to:

Drive trade studies

Bound performance reasoning

Identify dominant constraints

Eliminate implausible architectures

It is not used to:

Validate designs

Justify builds

Support proposals or contracts

Phase 2 Completion Condition (for This Step)

This step is complete when:

Environmental assumptions are explicit

No assumption implies validation

Later Phase 2 documents reference this envelope consistently

Plain-English Summary

This document defines the assumed environmental and operating conditions used for Phase 2 analysis of GEMS. These assumptions bound reasoning without claiming that the system has been tested, qualified, or proven to survive real environments.
