Phase 3 — Execution Gate Definition (Scope + License)

GEMS (Gas Emergency Management System)

Purpose

This document defines Phase 3, the execution gate for GEMS.

Phase 3 is the first phase that authorizes real-world action: building, testing, proposing, or commercializing work derived from GEMS materials.

No execution is permitted before Phase 3.

Phase 3 Role in the Phase Structure

Phase 1: Feasibility (frozen, non-commercial)

Phase 2: Analysis & planning (frozen, non-executing)

Phase 3: Permission to execute

Phase 3 does not require Phase 1 or Phase 2 to be “correct.”
It only requires that execution be explicitly authorized.

Phase 3 Scope (What Is Authorized)

Upon obtaining a Phase 3 execution license, the licensee may:

1. Physical Execution

Build prototypes

Fabricate components

Assemble test articles

Modify designs for execution feasibility

2. Testing & Validation

Conduct laboratory testing

Perform environmental testing

Run validation or characterization campaigns

Iterate designs based on test results

3. Proposal & Contract Use

Reference GEMS materials in proposals

Submit bids or responses

Incorporate GEMS concepts into funded work

4. Commercial & Product Development

Manufacture products

Integrate GEMS into systems

Commercialize derived hardware or services

Execution may occur only after Phase 3 authorization.

Phase 3 Explicit Non-Guarantees

Phase 3 does not guarantee:

Technical success

Performance outcomes

Certification

Safety approval

Market viability

Execution risk remains entirely with the licensee.

Phase 3 Execution License
License Fee

$5,000 USD — one-time execution permission fee.

What the Fee Covers

Authorization to execute work derived from GEMS

Permission to move from analysis into physical or commercial action

Legal clarity that execution is allowed

The fee does not include:

Engineering support

Technical review

Warranty

Ongoing consulting

License Grant (Execution)

Upon payment and acknowledgment, the licensee is granted:

A non-exclusive execution license

Permission to build, test, propose, and commercialize

Rights limited to GEMS-derived work

No exclusivity is implied unless separately negotiated.

License Restrictions

Without a Phase 3 execution license, you may not:

Build

Test

Fabricate

Propose

Manufacture

Sell

Deploy

Any such activity without authorization constitutes a license violation.

Termination

License terminates immediately upon breach

No retroactive permission is granted

All execution rights cease upon termination

Relationship to Earlier Phases

Phase 1 and Phase 2 remain frozen and unchanged

Phase 3 does not retroactively modify earlier phases

Phase 3 may contradict earlier assumptions during execution

Earlier phases inform execution but do not constrain it.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 3 is the point where thinking turns into permission. Paying the $5,000 execution fee grants the right to build, test, propose, or commercialize GEMS-derived work. Nothing before Phase 3 authorizes execution.
