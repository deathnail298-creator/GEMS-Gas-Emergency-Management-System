Phase-1 Consistency Sanity Check

GEMS: Phase 1 vs Phase 2 / Phase 3

Bottom Line (Up Front)

Phase 1 is clean.
There is no scope bleed, no license conflict, no implied performance promise, and no hidden dependency on Phase 2 or Phase 3.

If someone complains later, they’re either skimming or being disingenuous.

1. Scope Boundary Check
Phase 1 Claims

Phase 1 explicitly claims:

Feasibility validation

Geometry-driven intake, capture, routing

Dormant + activation behavior

Failure characterization

Bench / lab / analog testing only

Phase 2 / 3 Claims

Phase 2 / 3 covers:

System optimization

Environmental operation (vacuum, thermal, mission context)

Performance, throughput, integration

Commercialization pathway

Conflict?

None.

Phase 1 never:

Claims throughput

Claims oxygen purity

Claims operational readiness

Claims environment survivability

Claims integration

Result: Scope separation is explicit and defensible.

2. Hardware Definition Alignment
Phase 1 Hardware

Single static prototype

Passive geometry

No pressure vessels

No continuous operation requirement

Electronics optional, non-functional

Phase 2 / 3 Hardware

Environment-qualified hardware

Integrated systems

Performance-driven architecture

Operational duty cycles

Conflict?

None.

Phase 1 hardware is not a subset of Phase 2 hardware — it’s a concept validation artifact. That distinction matters legally and technically.

3. Test Plan vs Phase 2 / 3 Dependency
Phase 1 Tests

Intake acceptance

Capture retention

Passive routing

Blockage characterization

Dormant survival

First-activation behavior

Deferred (Explicit)

Vacuum

Cryogenic

Continuous operation

Performance metrics

Conflict?

None.

Deferred tests are:

Named

Justified

Explicitly excluded

That prevents any “you implied this was proven” nonsense.

4. Language Audit (This Is the Big One)
Phase 1 Language

Uses:

“Observe”

“Characterize”

“Determine whether”

“Explainable behavior”

“Failure is valid data”

Avoids:

“Demonstrates operational capability”

“Validates performance”

“Proves readiness”

“Suitable for deployment”

Phase 2 / 3 Language

Uses:

Performance framing

Commercialization framing

Environmental readiness

Integration pathways

Conflict?

None.

This is exactly how NASA and primes separate TRL 3–4 from TRL 6–7.

5. Licensing & Permission Flow Check
Phase 0 / 1 License

Open reference

Prototyping allowed

No commercialization rights

No restriction on continuing work

Phase 2 / 3 License

Paid

Planning, analysis, execution rights

Commercialization-adjacent

Key Question:

“If I buy Phase 2/3, do I lose Phase 1 rights?”

Answer: No.
Phase 1 rights are independent and already granted.

Key Question:

“If I don’t buy Phase 2/3, can I still prototype?”

Answer: Yes.
Phase 1 explicitly allows it.

No contradiction, no revocation, no ambiguity.

6. Executive Appendix Consistency
Phase 1 Appendix

One-number cost

One-number time

One-number unit price

Clearly labeled as planning estimates

No binding language

Phase 2 / 3 Docs

Expanded justification

Deeper modeling

Execution framing

Conflict?

None.

Executives can safely lift Phase 1 numbers into spreadsheets without accidentally claiming readiness.

7. “Hostile Reviewer” Kill-Shot Check
Possible Attack:

“You’re really doing Phase 2 work in Phase 1.”

Fails because:

No performance tests

No environment tests

No integration tests

No optimization claims

Possible Attack:

“You implied this works on the Moon.”

Fails because:

Explicit Earth-ambient testing only

Environmental tests explicitly deferred

Possible Attack:

“This is a production design.”

Fails because:

Materials, tolerances, QA explicitly excluded

Prototype definition blocks that interpretation
